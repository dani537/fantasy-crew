# 🏛️ President's Executive Order (The Strategist)
_Generated: 2026-02-03 02:10_

🏛️ **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**  
The situation is manageable but requires immediate action. Our balance is positive, but our squad depth is critically thin in defense and attack due to suspension (Vinícius Jr) and doubt (Griezmann). We must sell non‑contributors to fund two essential signings—a starting defender and a forward—while comfortably maintaining a positive balance. The proposed 3‑5‑2 lineup covers our weaknesses, and the market operations align with our core objectives.

### ✅ APPROVED OPERATIONS  

| # | Operation | Player | Amount | Reason |
|---|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **SELL** | Catena | €5,040,000 | Not a regular starter; frees significant funds for reinforcements. |
| 2 | **SELL** | Diego Rico | €1,070,000 | Not starting; minimal role, clears roster space. |
| 3 | **SELL** | Manu Sánchez | €920,000 | Away vs. Athletic, not starting; small loss acceptable. |
| 4 | **CLAUSE** | Matturro (DF – Levante) | €2,703,000 | Reliable defender (avg 4.0) with good clause value; addresses urgent DF need. |
| 5 | **CLAUSE** | Diangana (FW – Elche) | €990,000 | Solid forward depth (avg 3.25), excellent clause value; covers Vinícius absence/Griezmann doubt. |

### ❌ REJECTED OPERATIONS  

| Operation | Player | Reason for Rejection |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| SELL | Griezmann | Despite doubt, the huge sale loss (€‑13,414,056) is too severe; retain as bench option unless a strong offer emerges. |
| SELL | Álex Padilla | Required as GK coverage for Unai Simón (same team); cheap and necessary for squad depth. |
