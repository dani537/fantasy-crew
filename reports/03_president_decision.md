### 🏛️ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The current squad is financially stable but sportingly vulnerable, particularly in attack. With the clause window closed, our immediate focus is to optimize the roster by selling underperforming and redundant assets. This will generate liquidity and free squad slots, positioning us to aggressively address our critical need for a quality forward and a clear-starting midfielder in the next market window. We will field a competitive 3-5-2 lineup for the upcoming jornada to avoid point penalties, leveraging our midfield strength while acknowledging the forward line as our primary weakness to fix.

### ✅ APPROVED OPERATIONS
| # | Operation | Player | Amount | Reason |
|---|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | SELL | Boayar | €150,000 | Unusable forward (0 xP). Frees a roster spot. |
| 2 | SELL | Álex Padilla | €150,000 | Redundant backup GK. Zero risk sale. |
| 3 | SELL | Ander Yoldi | €150,000 | Unused forward with no projected role. |
| 4 | SELL | Diego Rico | €980,000 | Defender with 0 xP, not in plans. |
| 5 | SELL | Manu Sánchez | €950,000 | Defender with 0 xP, negative trend. |
| 6 | SELL | Griezmann | €5,220,000 | High-salary asset with sustained doubt and 0 xP. Frees significant budget for a reliable future replacement. |

### ❌ REJECTED OPERATIONS
| Operation | Player | Reason for Rejection |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| SELL | Vinícius Jr | Clause Protection Rule. Market price (€17.5M) is far below his clause value. Selling now would crystallize a massive loss. Retain for future value and potential clause activation. |
| SELL | Pedraza | Clause Protection Rule. Similar rationale to Vinícius. He is suspended but has value as a viable DF/MF option upon return. |
