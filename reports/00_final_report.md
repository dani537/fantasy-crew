## 📋 Coach's Report (The Mister)
### 🧠 Match Analysis
Examining the odds: **Barcelona (86% win probability)** at home vs. Mallorca is the most favorable fixture—excellent for Barcelona defenders. **Real Sociedad (57% win prob)** at home vs. Elche is also a strong opportunity. **Athletic (62% win prob)** at home vs. Levante is promising for our Athletic players. Tough away matches for **Real Madrid at Valencia** (only 64% win prob away) and **Osasuna at Celta** (only 23% win prob away) suggest caution with those players despite their quality.

### 📋 Squad Status
- **Out (Sanctioned):** Pedraza (DF), Vinícius Jr (FW).
- **Doubt:** Griezmann (FW) – fitness unclear, recent scores poor.
- **Starters likely (COMUNIATE_STARTER = 1):** Catena, Gumbau, Aramburu, Koundé, Kike García, Rioja, Pepelu, Rafa Marín, Tchouameni, Unai Simón, Muriqi, Vinícius Jr (suspended).
- **Form Standouts:** Muriqi (20 pts in last 5), Unai Simón (consistent), Rafa Marín (solid home avg), Koundé (strong home avg).

### ⚽ Recommended Lineup
**Formation**: 3-5-2  
*(We lack reliable forwards due to Vinícius suspension & Griezmann doubt, so we load the midfield.)*

- **GK**: **Unai Simón** – Clear starter, excellent form, home match vs. Levante.
- **DF**: **Koundé** (Barcelona) – Top home fixture, high win probability. **Rafa Marín** (Villarreal) – Home, decent avg. **Aramburu** (Real Sociedad) – Strong home fixture vs. Elche.
- **MF**: **Tchouameni** (Real Madrid) – Despite tough away match, he’s consistent and versatile. **Pepelu** (Valencia) – Home, good avg, on set-pieces. **Gumbau** (Rayo Vallecano) – Home, starter, cheap enabler. **Rioja** (Valencia) – Listed as FW but has MF alternate position; use him in MF to fill line. **Pol Lozano** (Espanyol) – Away but likely to start, decent avg.
- **FW**: **Muriqi** (Mallorca) – In outstanding form (20, 9, 9 last 3), even vs. Barcelona he can score. **Kike García** (Espanyol) – Away at Villarreal, but starter and avg away > home.

**Justification**: We avoid empty positions by using Rioja in MF (his alt position) and fielding two forwards who are fit and starting. The 3-5-2 maximizes our midfield strength and covers for missing forwards. Defense chosen for best home fixtures/highest win odds.

### 🚨 Urgent Needs
**NECESSITEM DF** – We have only 3 reliable defenders (Koundé, Rafa Marín, Aramburu) after suspending Pedraza. If any gets rotated, we risk -4. Also **NECESSITEM FW** – With Vinícius out and Griezmann doubtful, we lack forward depth.

### 💰 Market Strategy (For Sale)
1. **Catena** – REAL – Not starting regularly, negative profit but freeing up funds for a needed defender.
2. **Diego Rico** – REAL – Not starting, negative profit, clear roster clog.
3. **Griezmann** – RESERVE – Expensive, doubtful, huge sale loss; keep unless a great offer arrives.
4. **Álex Padilla** – RESERVE – Backup GK; keep as coverage for Unai Simón (same team).
5. **Manu Sánchez** – REAL – Not starting, away at Athletic, minimal profit loss.

## 💼 Sporting Director's Proposals (The Broker)
### 💵 Financial Diagnosis
Current balance is **€2,378,062**, which is positive. However, to fund necessary signings and maintain a healthy buffer, we will generate liquidity by selling non‑starting assets. The goal is to stay well above €0 after all transactions, complying with the critical rule.

### 🎯 Target Signings
We prioritize a starting‑caliber defender and a forward with good value. The clause window is open, enabling immediate buyouts.

| Player | Type | Price/Clause | Rationale |
|--------|------|--------------|-----------|
| **Matturro** (Levante – DF) | Clause | €2,703,000 | Strong average (4.0), decent clause value (1.08021). Provides a reliable third defender alongside Koundé and Rafa Marín. |
| **Diangana** (Elche – FW) | Clause | €990,000 | Good forward depth, avg 3.25, clause value 1.63317. Addresses the urgent need with Vinícius suspended and Griezmann doubtful. |

### 📤 Recommended Sales
Sell underperforming, non‑starting players to raise funds and clear roster space. Although these sales realize losses, the players are not contributing and the cash is needed for reinforcements.

| Player | Suggested Price | Reason |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| **Catena** | €5,040,000 | Not starting regularly; frees up significant funds. |
| **Diego Rico** | €1,070,000 | Not starting; minimal role in squad. |
| **Manu Sánchez** | €920,000 | Away fixture vs. Athletic, not starting; small loss acceptable. |

### ⚖️ Final Forecast
```
Current Balance:    €2,378,062
+ Expected Sales:   €7,030,000 (Catena €5.04M + Diego Rico €1.07M + Manu Sánchez €0.92M)
- Expected Buys:    €3,693,000 (Matturro €2.703M + Diangana €0.99M)
= Projected Balance: €5,715,062
```
**Result:** Well above €0 – rule satisfied, and we have strengthened two weak positions.

## 🏛️ President's Decisions (The Strategist)
🏛️ **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**  
The situation is manageable but requires immediate action. Our balance is positive, but our squad depth is critically thin in defense and attack due to suspension (Vinícius Jr) and doubt (Griezmann). We must sell non‑contributors to fund two essential signings—a starting defender and a forward—while comfortably maintaining a positive balance. The proposed 3‑5‑2 lineup covers our weaknesses, and the market operations align with our core objectives.

### ✅ APPROVED OPERATIONS  

| # | Operation | Player | Amount | Reason |
|---|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | **SELL** | Catena | €5,040,000 | Not a regular starter; frees significant funds for reinforcements. |
| 2 | **SELL** | Diego Rico | €1,070,000 | Not starting; minimal role, clears roster space. |
| 3 | **SELL** | Manu Sánchez | €920,000 | Away vs. Athletic, not starting; small loss acceptable. |
| 4 | **CLAUSE** | Matturro (DF – Levante) | €2,703,000 | Reliable defender (avg 4.0) with good clause value; addresses urgent DF need. |
| 5 | **CLAUSE** | Diangana (FW – Elche) | €990,000 | Solid forward depth (avg 3.25), excellent clause value; covers Vinícius absence/Griezmann doubt. |

---

### ❌ REJECTED OPERATIONS  

| Operation | Player | Reason for Rejection |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| SELL | Griezmann | Despite doubt, the huge sale loss (€‑13,414,056) is too severe; retain as bench option unless a strong offer emerges. |
| SELL | Álex Padilla | Required as GK coverage for Unai Simón (same team); cheap and necessary for squad depth. |
