## 📋 Coach Report
### 🧠 Match Analysis
The upcoming matches present a mix of opportunities and challenges. Barcelona (vs. Mallorca) and Real Sociedad (vs. Elche) have the highest implied win probabilities (87% and 60% respectively at home), favoring players like **Koundé** and **Aramburu**. Teams with strong home advantage include **Atlético** (74% vs. Betis) and **Athletic** (62% vs. Levante), boosting **Unai Simón** and **Griezmann**'s prospects (if fit). Conversely, tough away fixtures for **Real Madrid** at Valencia (65% win prob for Madrid) still offer upside for **Tchouameni**. The key is navigating player absences: **Vinícius Jr** (sanctioned), **Pedraza** (sanctioned), and **Griezmann** (doubtful) are major concerns.

### 📋 Squad Status
- **Unavailable/Suspended**: Vinícius Jr, Pedraza.
- **Injury Doubt**: Griezmann (fitness shows consecutive 'doubt' entries). His 0.0 xP reflects high uncertainty.
- **Standout Form (High xP & Positive Momentum)**: Pepelu (6.0 xP, +1.5 trend), Unai Simón (6.0 xP, +1.27), Aramburu (5.8 xP, +1.8), Koundé (5.4 xP, +0.92), Tchouameni (5.25 xP, +0.04).
- **Concerns**: Rafa Marín (2.2 xP, -2.8 trend), Manu Sánchez (0 xP, negative trend), Diego Rico (0 xP). Several players have 0 xP due to low starter probability.

### ⚽ Recommended Lineup
**Formation**: 3-5-2  
*(Chosen due to Vinícius' suspension and Griezmann's doubt, leaving only two reliable forwards. This maximizes the use of our strong midfielders with high xP.)*

- **GK**: **Unai Simón** (ATH) - Clear starter, highest GK xP (6.0), home match vs. Levante (62% win prob).
- **DF**: **Koundé** (BAR) - Starter (1.0), excellent fixture (87% win prob), solid xP (5.4).
- **DF**: **Aramburu** (RSO) - Starter (1.0), best DF xP (5.8), home vs. Elche (60% win prob).
- **DF**: **Catena** (OSA) - Starter (1.0), decent xP (3.75). Despite away at Celta, he is a guaranteed starter.
- **MF**: **Pepelu** (VAL) - Locked starter (1.0), highest squad xP (6.0). Tough fixture but essential.
- **MF**: **Tchouameni** (RMA) - Starter (1.0), high xP (5.25). Madrid are favorites away at Valencia.
- **MF**: **Pol Lozano** (ESP) - Starter (1.0), xP 3.0. Away at Villarreal is tough, but we need his guaranteed minutes.
- **MF**: **Gumbau** (RAY) - 60% starter chance (0.6), xP 1.2. Home vs. Oviedo gives him a reasonable opportunity.
- **MF**: **Pablo Torre** (MAL) - Not a starter (0.0 xP), but his strong momentum (+0.9) and bench potential make him a better 5th MF option than players like **Boayar** or **Kike García** as a forward. He can cover MF/FW.
- **FW**: **Rioja** (VAL) - Starter (1.0), solid xP (4.8). Must start despite tough fixture.
- **FW**: **Kike García** (ESP) - Not a starter (0.0 xP), but chosen over Boayar due to slightly better recent form and the need to fill the position. This is the weakest link.

**Key Decisions**:  
1.  **3-5-2 over 3-4-3**: With Vinícius out and Griezmann doubtful, we only have one reliable forward (Rioja). The 3-5-2 allows us to field five midfielders with higher collective xP than forcing a third forward with 0.0 xP.
2.  **Pablo Torre over Kike García/Boayar in the 11**: Torre’s MF eligibility and positive momentum offer more upside as a flex player than a 0 xP forward.
3.  **Catena over Rafa Marín/Diego Rico**: Guaranteed starter status (1.0) outweighs Marín's low xP and negative trend.

### 🚨 Urgent Needs
**NECESSITEM 1 FW (de qualitat)**. The forward line is critically weak. **NECESSITEM 1 MF (titular clar)** to upgrade the Gumbau/Torre slot for more consistent points.

### 💰 Market Strategy (For Sale)
1.  **Vinícius Jr** - RESERVE - Sanctioned this week. **DO NOT SELL**. His market price (17.5M) is far below his clause value. Selling now would crystallize a massive loss. Hold and wait for his return and potential clause activation.
2.  **Pedraza** - RESERVE - Sanctioned and with good historical form. Similar to Vinícius, selling at a low price (1.9M) likely incurs a loss vs. acquisition cost. Keep as a viable DF/MF option once available.
3.  **Griezmann** - REAL - High salary, doubtful fitness, and 0.0 xP. The sustained 'doubt' status and negative momentum trend (-0.75) indicate a declining, unreliable asset. Consider selling to free up significant budget for a reliable forward, even at a potential loss.
4.  **Boayar** - REAL - Minimal price (150k), 0.0 xP, and not a starter. He is a truly unusable player who occupies a roster spot. Sell to free space.
5.  **Álex Padilla** - REAL - Backup GK for Unai Simón. Per the rules, we have automatic coverage with two GKs from the same team. He is redundant and has 0 value. Selling him incurs no risk and frees a roster spot.

## 💼 Sporting Director Proposals
### 💵 Financial Diagnosis
Current balance is **€27,558,062**, which is comfortably positive. No immediate liquidity risk. However, to fund future signings (a quality forward and a clear-starting midfielder as per coach’s urgent needs) and free up roster spots, we will execute strategic sales of underperforming or redundant assets. The clause window is closed and no free agents are available, so no signings can be made at this time.

### 🎯 Target Signings
*No signings possible at the moment.*  
- The clause window is **CLOSED** (deadline: 2026-02-04 21:00).  
- The free-agent market currently shows **no available players**.  
- We will wait for the next clause window to address the squad’s weaknesses with cost-efficient targets.

### 📤 Recommended Sales
The following players are recommended for sale to generate funds and optimize the squad. Prices are set at their current market value to ensure a quick sale while minimizing losses on high-investment players.

| Player | Suggested Price | Reason |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Boayar | €150,000 | Unusable forward (0 xP, not a starter). Frees a roster spot. |
| Álex Padilla | €150,000 | Redundant backup GK (0 xP). We have automatic coverage with Unai Simón. |
| Ander Yoldi | €150,000 | Unused forward (0 xP, no momentum). No projected minutes. |
| Diego Rico | €980,000 | Defender with 0 xP and negative trend. Not in lineup plans. |
| Manu Sánchez | €950,000 | Defender with 0 xP and negative trend. Not in lineup plans. |
| Griezmann | €5,220,000 | High-salary forward with sustained doubt (0 xP, negative trend). Selling frees budget for a reliable replacement, even at a potential loss. |

**Important holds:**  
- **Vinícius Jr** and **Pedraza** are suspended but have clause values far above market price. Selling now would crystallize a large loss. Retain for future value.  
- **Kike García** is kept for this week’s lineup due to forward shortage.  
- **Rafa Marín** is retained as defensive cover despite negative trend.

### ⚖️ Final Forecast
Estimated balance after all sales (no purchases possible):

```
Current Balance:    €27,558,062
+ Expected Sales:   €7,600,000
- Expected Buys:    €0
= Projected Balance: €35,158,062
```

*Note: All sales are subject to market demand. The projected balance ensures ample liquidity for future signings when the clause window reopens.*

## 🏛️ President Decision
### 🏛️ EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The current squad is financially stable but sportingly vulnerable, particularly in attack. With the clause window closed, our immediate focus is to optimize the roster by selling underperforming and redundant assets. This will generate liquidity and free squad slots, positioning us to aggressively address our critical need for a quality forward and a clear-starting midfielder in the next market window. We will field a competitive 3-5-2 lineup for the upcoming jornada to avoid point penalties, leveraging our midfield strength while acknowledging the forward line as our primary weakness to fix.

### ✅ APPROVED OPERATIONS
| # | Operation | Player | Amount | Reason |
|---|-----------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | SELL | Boayar | €150,000 | Unusable forward (0 xP). Frees a roster spot. |
| 2 | SELL | Álex Padilla | €150,000 | Redundant backup GK. Zero risk sale. |
| 3 | SELL | Ander Yoldi | €150,000 | Unused forward with no projected role. |
| 4 | SELL | Diego Rico | €980,000 | Defender with 0 xP, not in plans. |
| 5 | SELL | Manu Sánchez | €950,000 | Defender with 0 xP, negative trend. |
| 6 | SELL | Griezmann | €5,220,000 | High-salary asset with sustained doubt and 0 xP. Frees significant budget for a reliable future replacement. |

### ❌ REJECTED OPERATIONS
| Operation | Player | Reason for Rejection |
|-----------|--------|---------------------|
| SELL | Vinícius Jr | Clause Protection Rule. Market price (€17.5M) is far below his clause value. Selling now would crystallize a massive loss. Retain for future value and potential clause activation. |
| SELL | Pedraza | Clause Protection Rule. Similar rationale to Vinícius. He is suspended but has value as a viable DF/MF option upon return. |
