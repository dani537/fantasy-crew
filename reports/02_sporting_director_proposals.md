### 💵 Financial Diagnosis
Current balance is **€2,378,062**, which is positive. However, to fund necessary signings and maintain a healthy buffer, we will generate liquidity by selling non‑starting assets. The goal is to stay well above €0 after all transactions, complying with the critical rule.

### 🎯 Target Signings
We prioritize a starting‑caliber defender and a forward with good value. The clause window is open, enabling immediate buyouts.

| Player | Type | Price/Clause | Rationale |
|--------|------|--------------|-----------|
| **Matturro** (Levante – DF) | Clause | €2,703,000 | Strong average (4.0), decent clause value (1.08021). Provides a reliable third defender alongside Koundé and Rafa Marín. |
| **Diangana** (Elche – FW) | Clause | €990,000 | Good forward depth, avg 3.25, clause value 1.63317. Addresses the urgent need with Vinícius suspended and Griezmann doubtful. |

### 📤 Recommended Sales
Sell underperforming, non‑starting players to raise funds and clear roster space. Although these sales realize losses, the players are not contributing and the cash is needed for reinforcements.

| Player | Suggested Price | Reason |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| **Catena** | €5,040,000 | Not starting regularly; frees up significant funds. |
| **Diego Rico** | €1,070,000 | Not starting; minimal role in squad. |
| **Manu Sánchez** | €920,000 | Away fixture vs. Athletic, not starting; small loss acceptable. |

### ⚖️ Final Forecast
```
Current Balance:    €2,378,062
+ Expected Sales:   €7,030,000 (Catena €5.04M + Diego Rico €1.07M + Manu Sánchez €0.92M)
- Expected Buys:    €3,693,000 (Matturro €2.703M + Diangana €0.99M)
= Projected Balance: €5,715,062
```
**Result:** Well above €0 – rule satisfied, and we have strengthened two weak positions.
