### 💵 Financial Diagnosis
Current balance is **€27,558,062**, which is comfortably positive. No immediate liquidity risk. However, to fund future signings (a quality forward and a clear-starting midfielder as per coach’s urgent needs) and free up roster spots, we will execute strategic sales of underperforming or redundant assets. The clause window is closed and no free agents are available, so no signings can be made at this time.

### 🎯 Target Signings
*No signings possible at the moment.*  
- The clause window is **CLOSED** (deadline: 2026-02-04 21:00).  
- The free-agent market currently shows **no available players**.  
- We will wait for the next clause window to address the squad’s weaknesses with cost-efficient targets.

### 📤 Recommended Sales
The following players are recommended for sale to generate funds and optimize the squad. Prices are set at their current market value to ensure a quick sale while minimizing losses on high-investment players.

| Player | Suggested Price | Reason |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Boayar | €150,000 | Unusable forward (0 xP, not a starter). Frees a roster spot. |
| Álex Padilla | €150,000 | Redundant backup GK (0 xP). We have automatic coverage with Unai Simón. |
| Ander Yoldi | €150,000 | Unused forward (0 xP, no momentum). No projected minutes. |
| Diego Rico | €980,000 | Defender with 0 xP and negative trend. Not in lineup plans. |
| Manu Sánchez | €950,000 | Defender with 0 xP and negative trend. Not in lineup plans. |
| Griezmann | €5,220,000 | High-salary forward with sustained doubt (0 xP, negative trend). Selling frees budget for a reliable replacement, even at a potential loss. |

**Important holds:**  
- **Vinícius Jr** and **Pedraza** are suspended but have clause values far above market price. Selling now would crystallize a large loss. Retain for future value.  
- **Kike García** is kept for this week’s lineup due to forward shortage.  
- **Rafa Marín** is retained as defensive cover despite negative trend.

### ⚖️ Final Forecast
Estimated balance after all sales (no purchases possible):

```
Current Balance:    €27,558,062
+ Expected Sales:   €7,600,000
- Expected Buys:    €0
= Projected Balance: €35,158,062
```

*Note: All sales are subject to market demand. The projected balance ensures ample liquidity for future signings when the clause window reopens.*
